## [2.0.1] - 2019-09-11

## [2.0.0] - 2019-08-14

### Deprecated NuGet Packages
The following Nuget packages are deprecated. Bugs will still be fixed but no new features will be implemented in them.
- `Snapper.Core`
- `Snapper.Json`
- `Snapper.Json.Xunit`
- `Snapper.Json.Nunit`

### New NuGet Packages
- Introduced `Snapper` as the main nuget package. It provides all the functionality of `Snapper.Json` + `Snapper.Json.Xunit` as well as basic support for `NUnit`.
- Introduced `Snapper.Nunit` to provide extra `NUnit` specific features to Snapper. This package extends `NUnit's` constraints to match the functionality provided by deprecated package `Snapper.Json.Nunit`.

### Behaviour changes compared to V1
- Matching a snapshot previously created a json file based on the method name of the test. In V2 the json file is based on this format `{className}_{methodName}.json`.
- Matching a snapshot and passing in a snapshot name has been removed. A similar method has been introduced for having child snapshots. Useful for theory type tests.

### New Features
- **Child snapshots!** Child snapshots are a nice new way of creating snapshots for theory tests.
- **Inline snapshots!** Sometimes snapshots are small and it's not worth making a json file. Inline snapshots allow you to provide an object/string/json string which it can use as the snapshot.
- You can now use any object for snapshots. Previously an object that could not be converted into a JToken caused an exception. Now Snapper sanitises these objects so that they can be used in snapshots.

## [2.0.0-beta3] - 2019-05-26
### Added
- Updated `Snapper` and `Snapper.Nunit` to upload symbols to nuget symbols server

## [2.0.0-beta2] - 2019-05-26
### Added
- Updated `Snapper` and `Snapper.Nunit` to be strong named
- Updated `Snapper` and `Snapper.Nunit` to have sourcelink enabled
