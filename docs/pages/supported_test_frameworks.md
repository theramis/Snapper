## How to add support for a new test framework
Contributions are always welcome and adding support for a new test framework is very easy.

To add support for a new test framework follow the following steps.

1. Create a new class which implements `ITestMethod`. See [XunitFactMethod](https://github.com/theramis/Snapper/blob/master/project/Snapper/Core/TestMethodResolver/TestMethods/XunitFactMethod.cs) for an example.
2. Update [TestMethodResolver](https://github.com/theramis/Snapper/blob/master/project/Snapper/Core/TestMethodResolver/TestMethodResolver.cs#L16) to include the newly made class.
3. Create some tests to make sure the new test framework is working in the [Snapper.TestFrameworkSupport.Tests](https://github.com/theramis/Snapper/tree/master/project/Tests/Snapper.TestFrameworkSupport.Tests) project.
4. Create a PR with the changes.
